This is a comprehensive test of the AES encryption algorithm.
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data.
It was established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.
AES is based on the Rijndael cipher and uses key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
This test will verify that our implementation works correctly for both ECB and CBC modes.
