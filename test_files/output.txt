This is a comprehensive test of the DES encryption algorithm.
DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data.
Although its short key length of 56 bits makes it too insecure for modern applications,
it was highly influential in the advancement of cryptography.
This test will verify that our implementation works correctly for both ECB and CBC modes.
